General analysis of the NYC taxi dataset - 10 scripts and visualisations

1. Merging yellow and green taxi datasets

The Yellow and green taxi journey records comprise details such as pick-up and drop-off timings, locations of both start and finish, journey lengths, detailed fares, rate classifications, modes of payment, and counts of passengers as reported by drivers. These datasets have been sourced and given to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by authorized tech providers from the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP).
